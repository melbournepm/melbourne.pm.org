<h3><a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Developers'
Conference</a></h3>
<p>
Melbourne Perl Mongers is a big supporter of Australia's <a
href="http://www.osdc.com.au">Open Source Developers' Conference</a>.  This
conference has been a huge success for the Australian Open Source community
since 2004 and always includes streams for Perl, Python, PHP, Mono and
other Open Source programming tools.  We'd like to thank the Brisbane team
for doing such a great job last year!
</p>
<p>
This conference will run for the fifth time in November 2008.  This will be
run in Sydney, Australia for the first time.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub">Open Source Developers'
Club</a></h3>
<p>
The 2004 Open Source Developers' Conference was a huge success in bringing
together programmers of many programming languages.  Thus, in March 2005,
Melbourne Perl Mongers chose to share its meetings with a new group: <i>the
Open Source Developers' Club</i>.  The focus of these meetings is to
discuss technologies common to all attendees such as databases and data
formats.
</p>
<p>
OSDClub meetings run on a bimonthly basis and are hosted by various open
source language user groups in Melbourne, including Melbourne Perl Mongers
and <a href="http://melbourne.ug.php.net/">the Melbourne PHP Users
Group</a>.
</p>
<p>
For information on when and where the next OSDClub meeting will be, see <a
